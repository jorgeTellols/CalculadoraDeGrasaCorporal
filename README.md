# Body Fat Calculator

Small application that calculates the user's body fat percentage based on introduced data. The application supports both metric and imperial units (Anglo-Saxon system) and shows a small "guide" on how to perform the measurements while explaining the method used for the calculation of the final result.

I made this small application to test a little the Vue.js framework and see how it worked, so it is only a purely front application as it has no database or any kind of back dimension.
